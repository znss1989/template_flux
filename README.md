This is the template project for a typical ReactJS project developed using the Flux architecture.

This major procedure is borrowed from [bradtraversy/fluxboiler](https://github.com/bradtraversy/fluxboiler). But the deprecated [**reactify**](https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify) has be updated to [**babelify**](https://github.com/babel/babelify) instead.

To use this template,
1. Clone to current project
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp`
